# Java Design Patterns

Creating small example projects for all of the main design patterns that I am practicing in Java. All projects have a GUI component at this point although this could change in the future

## Memento Pattern - Calculator App 
Implemented the memento pattern to create a 4 function calculator that saves the calculator state and allows you to undo operations returning to the previous value

## State Pattern - Test Music Player
An example of a simple music player that has different functionality for 3 different states locked, ready and playing with the ability to switch between the states

## Iterator Pattern - Calculator App V2 
Extending the functionality of the first calculator adding the ability to display the entire history of the calculator by iteratoring through history states
